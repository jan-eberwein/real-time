# Task

Find an object with an interesting appearance (surface, texture, roughness, …) and take a picture of it. Take multiple images in different lighting situations. Ideal are objects with different and interesting materials (e.g., plastic, wood, metal, rust, …). 

Then try to recreate the object’s appearance as a physically-based-rendering material and use it in our example application. Define the textures required: roughness, metalness, albedo, [if needed: AO, normal map].

You can use a model (new or reuse an earlier model), or simply use a flat plane (quad).
