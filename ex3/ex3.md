# Task:
1. Implement a Postprocessing Effect: Choose and create a custom postprocessing effect such as motion blur, color correction, vignetting, or film grain, considering the space it will operate in and whether it should be an additional pass in the pipeline.

2. Toggle Functionality: Enable turning your effect on and off within the program.

3. Documentation: Write a concise report on your chosen effect and its implementation, detailing its use in graphics programming and the process of integrating it into the pipeline.

You can use a custom scene. If your model has the texture names in an MTL file, they will be loaded automatically and bound during shading.

Please work in teams and upload a progress report as a PDF and your source code files. Make sure to provide screenshots (and optionally videos) of your effect. 

This assignment encourages independent research and practical application of course concepts. The goal isn't perfection, but gaining a deeper understanding of the topic.
